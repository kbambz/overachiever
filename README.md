Overachiever
============

A WildStar addon that helps you be a good little completionist!

**You must have [TrackMaster](www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/220025-track-master) installed to use Overachiever!** 


What's it do?
-------------

Overachiever:

* Tracks lore items that you need to read (journals, datacubes).

* Tracks rare mobs that you need to kill (for "I Like It Rare: <Zone>", etc).

* Tracks path missions that you have yet to complete.
